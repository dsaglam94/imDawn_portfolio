# imDawn_portfolio

Hey guys!

Whew! Finally I was able to finish my portfolio.

It's responsive to 3 different screen sizes like tablet, phone and desktop.

It took more time than I anticipated but it was a good experience since I built this site from scratch. It taught me many things also provided me good practice.

I used:
SASS & BEM (name convention)
HTML5
JavaScript (mostly for the menu toggle and theme changer)

You can check my code and get inspired. Grab it and make it better!
And if you have any recommendation or questions just feel free to reach me from my twitter.

I'd love to hear your opinions and questions.

Happy coding y'all!
